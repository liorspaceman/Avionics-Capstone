%% AER 822 â€“W2021 FINAL MISSION PROFILE
% 1.Take off at a selected initial position of 10 degrees below the horizontal 
% elevation position and stabilize at SLF with demonstrated high speed and steady 
% state accuracy in elevation positioning.
% 
% 2.Maintain the elevation angle and travel in clockwise direction for 120 degrees 
% with an adequate speed and stop travelling with demonstrated tracking accuracy 
% (position and velocity errors) and steady state accuracy in both travel and 
% elevation positioning. 
% 
% 3.Starting with zero travel speed, travel in counterclockwise direction for 
% 100 degrees with highest possible speed and fully stop at the end with an overshoot 
% of no more than 10 degrees, while maintaining demonstrated small tracking errors 
% in both travel and elevation.
% 
% 4.Continue travel in counterclockwise direction for 20 degrees with slow speed 
% and fully stop at the end with an overshoot of no more than 1 degree, while 
% maintaining demonstrated small tracking errors in both travel and elevation.
% 
% 5.Land at the original initial position as fast as possible but with minimum 
% overshoot (as small as possible but no more than 1 degree.
